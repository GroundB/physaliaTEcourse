# Practical 3: Commands for running repeatModelerPipeline

# Note: Due to time limitations, repeatModelerPipeline was pre-run on the UPPMAX server (8 cores).

# Note: This is an in-house pipeline for collecting 20 best BLASTn hits per raw RepeatModeler consensus, adding 2-kb flanks on each side, and generating one alignment per consensus. BLASTn results are collected in the subfolder "blast" and alignments are saved in the subfolder "aligned".

# Default settings are 20 hits and 2-kb flanks (can be changed in repeatModelerPipeline4.pl itself).

# If there are issues with running this on your computing environment, try alternative pipelines such as Process_hits (https://bmcresnotes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1756-0500-4-482).

# Program version: repeatModelerPipeline4.pl

# Make a copy of nHd_rm1.0.lib without "/" to be compatible with repeatModelerPipeline (sequence names are used as alignment file names):
sed 's|/|_|g' nHd_rm1.0.lib >nHd_rm1.0_noSlash.lib

# Make BLASTn database:
mkdir repeatModelerPipeline
cd repeatModelerPipeline
makeblastdb -in "../nHd3.1.fa" -title nHd3.1 -dbtype "nucl" -parse_seqids -out nHd3.1

# Run repeatModelerPipeline:
perl repeatModelerPipeline4.pl ../nHd3.1.fa nHd3.1 ../nHd3.1_rmodel/nHd_rm1.0_noSlash.lib

### If repeatModelerPipeline ran successfully, time to do post-processing of files. Processed files will be saved in folder "final".

# Cleanup of temporary files:
rm *emp.out
mkdir final

# Remove redundant sequences from alignments and save in folder "final":
cd aligned; for i in $(ls *.fa); do name=`ls $i | cut -f1 -d "."`; cat $i |perl -ne 'chomp;s/>\s+/>/;if(/>(\S+)/){$id{$1}++;$id2=$1;}if($id{$id2}==1){print "$_\n"}' >../final/$name.fa; done; cd ../

### If repeatModelerPipeline crashed halfway (which sometimes happens for memory reasons during the alignment step), proceed as follows:

# Change repeatModelerPipeline4.pl itself by adding a "#" in the beginning of line 48 and line 51.

# Move already processed "blastn" files and "aligned" files as shown below.

# Rename aligned folder and make a list of file names:
mv aligned >aligned_part1
ls aligned_part1 >aligned_part1.list
mkdir blastn_part1

# Match blastn files from file name list and copy/move these into a separate blastn folder:
cat aligned_part1.list | while read line; do  name==`echo $line`; mv blastn/$line blastn_part1/; done

# Now re-start repeatModelerPipeline with a larger memory allocation.

### If helpful, make alignments less gappy with T-Coffee, e.g., version T-Coffee/11.00.8cbe486



# Remove alignment positions with gaps in more than 90% of the sequences:

cd final
export CACHE_4_TCOFFEE=[path_to_your_bin]
for i in $(ls *.fa); do name=`ls $i | cut -f1 -d "."`; [path_to_T-COFFEE]t_coffee -other_pg seq_reformat -in $i -action +rm_gap 90 >$name.nogaps90.fa; done

# Note: Make sure to keep the original alignments for your records and for double-checking in case something looks fishy in the less gappy alignments.
